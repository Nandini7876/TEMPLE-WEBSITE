    <h2 class="mb-4">History</h2>
    <p>The ancient Somnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is one of the most revered and important pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Located in the Prabhas Kshetra near Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat, India, the temple has a history that spans over thousands of years.</p>
    <p><strong>Ancient Origins:</strong> The exact origins of the Somnath Temple are shrouded in myth and legend. According to Hindu mythology, the temple is believed to have been originally built by the moon god Soma, and later reconstructed by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. It is said that Lord Krishna himself visited the temple during his lifetime.</p>
    <p><strong>Renewal by Bhagwan Shree Vallabhacharya:</strong> In the 10th century, the temple was restored by Bhagwan Shree Vallabhacharya, a prominent Hindu philosopher and proponent of the Pushtimarg sect. His efforts helped revive the temple's glory and significance.</p>
    <p><strong>Destruction and Reconstruction:</strong> The history of the Somnath Temple is marked by numerous instances of destruction and reconstruction. It is believed that the temple was destroyed and rebuilt several times by various invaders and rulers. One of the most infamous incidents was the sack of the temple by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1026 CE. Mahmud looted the temple and destroyed its grand structure, but it was rebuilt again by devotees.</p>
    <p><strong>Patronage by Chaulukya Dynasty:</strong> The Chaulukya dynasty, also known as the Solanki dynasty, played a crucial role in the restoration and patronage of the Somnath Temple during the medieval period. Under their rule, the temple was reconstructed with grandeur and became a center of pilgrimage and cultural significance.</p>
    <p><strong>Reconstruction in the Modern Era:</strong> In the modern era, efforts were made to reconstruct and restore the Somnath Temple to its former glory. The present structure of the temple was inaugurated on May 11, 1951, by the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, after a significant renovation project led by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.</p>
    <p><strong>Symbol of Resilience and Faith:</strong> Throughout its tumultuous history, the Somnath Temple has emerged as a symbol of resilience, faith, and devotion. Despite facing destruction and invasions, it has been rebuilt time and again by devotees who hold it in the highest reverence.</p>
    <p>Today, the Somnath Temple stands as a magnificent testament to the enduring spirit of Hinduism and continues to attract millions of pilgrims and tourists from around the world who seek spiritual solace and enlightenment at this sacred site.</p>
